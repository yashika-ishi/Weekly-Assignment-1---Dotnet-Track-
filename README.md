## 🌟 Overview
This project is a simple Student Management System API built with **ASP.NET Core**. It serves as a practical example of applying **CQRS** for clear separation of read (Queries) and write (Commands) operations, utilizing the **MediatR** library to implement the **Mediator pattern**.

Data persistence is handled by **Entity Framework Core** using an **InMemory Database**, which is pre-seeded with three initial student records upon application startup.

### ✨ Key Features
* **CQRS Implementation:** Strict separation between data modification and data retrieval logic.
* **Mediator Pattern:** Uses **MediatR** to decouple senders (Controllers) from handlers (Business Logic).
* **Core CRUD Operations:**
    * Add a new student
    * Update student details
    * Delete a student
    * Retrieve all students
* **EF Core InMemory Database:** Lightweight, in-memory data store for quick setup and testing.
* **Pre-Seeded Data:** Starts with 3 ready-to-use student entries.
